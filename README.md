## Short Introduction to Solidity

A short and sweet intro to programming in Solidity for the Ethereum Blockchain

## Node.js

Some of the projects in this repo can be deployed using Truffle framework. In order for truffle to work we need nodejs installed. Node.js can be installed by downloading from: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

#### On Windows

Run the following command:

    npm install -g windows-build-tools

This will take a really long time (around 20 minutes or so). When the install completes
run the following command:

    npm --add-python-to-path -g windows-build-tools
	
#### If you are getting Python version errors:

Npm needs Python 2.7. Run the following command to force npm to use the correct version
of Python:

    npm config set python python2.7
